ryan_armoury is a script for FiveM servers that use the QBCore framework. It provides an interactive police armory where law enforcement personnel can access weapons, items, and equipment based on their job grade. The armory locations are marked by NPCs who have randomized appearances, including different hair, beards, facial features, and accessories like hats.

Features

NPC Interaction: NPCs with randomized appearances (hair, beard, facial features, accessories) serve as visual indicators and interaction points for accessing the armory.
Job-based Access: Only players with the "police" job can access the armory, with restrictions based on job grades.
Dynamic Menu: Offers a dynamic menu that adjusts based on the player's grade and the items available to them.
Bulk Purchase: Allows bulk purchasing of certain items (e.g., ammo, body armor) while restricting others (e.g., weapons) to a single purchase.
Society Fund Integration: Deducts the cost of purchased items directly from the police department's society fund using qb-banking.
